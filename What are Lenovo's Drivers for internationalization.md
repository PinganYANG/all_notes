2009 A third international expansion phase begins in 2009, after the IBM acquisition has been completely digested. As an essential element of its “Protect & Attack” strategic plan (see Exhibit 1), Lenovo’s priority objective is no longer quantitative international growth but rather to take advantage of its global reach while protecting and even shoring up its position in its original market, the Chinese market

A central event of this third phase is the reorganization of the foreign operations along geographical market characteristics, featuring two new divisions (see Exhibit 3): “Mature” which 13 covers Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, the United States, Canada and Japan and “Emerging” which includes China, Taiwan, Korea, Pakistan, India, the ASEAN countries, Russia, the Middle East, Turkey and Africa. This distinction between mature and emerging regions will matter when we look at the growth levels seen in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and those expected for the following years (see Table 8).
